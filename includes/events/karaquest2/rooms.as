Each is scantily clad with transparent silks clinging around her breasts and hips, if she's wearing anything at all. Each bears a finely wrought gold chain linked between her pierced nipples, among other jewelry all meant to evoke and arouse. The only article that stands out is the slim metal collar each and every one of them wears, a solid band of steel adorned only with a small holographic readout projecting just under the chin. The girls look up as you and Kara enter, their eyes vacant and lusty; several of them make sensual little moans, others cup their breasts or crawl toward you over the cushions.";
